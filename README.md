# Binary Trees

## Usage

1. You can create a normal binary tree by simply inserting random nodes (although this was made with the intention of sorting and balancing a binary tree and then using it).
2. The interactive menu gives you the possibility to search for and delete specific nodes.
3. After inserting a random binary tree you can save it into a file for later use (It will not save as a sorted or balanced tree).
4. Along with that you can also display the tree. (See screenshots for more details).
